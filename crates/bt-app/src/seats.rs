//! The seat tree this window hosts, and the chrome drawn around it.
//!
//! `docs/M2-layout-solver-spec.md` §4.1 draws the seam this module sits on:
//!
//! ```text
//! window geometry -> viewport rect -> solve -> seat rects -> (terminal) cols/rows
//!    -> ConPTY 200ms quiet coalescing (existing, inherited unchanged)
//!    -> LayoutKey { width, dpi, font_rev, theme_rev }
//! ```
//!
//! Red line L10 forbids the reverse: nothing downstream of `solve` — not a
//! formula that grew tall, not an inline image, not a long filename — may ask
//! for a different seat rectangle. Everything in this file therefore *consumes*
//! the solver's answer and never feeds it, and the one input the solver takes
//! from the window is the viewport rectangle itself.
//!
//! Red line L1 is the other half: the solver is told a `SeatKind` and nothing
//! about content. Which session lives in the terminal seat, which file the
//! preview shows — those never enter a `LayoutNode`.
